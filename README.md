# Davie-Robot-Arm
 
My engineering degree project

A 6-axis robot arm controlled by voice commandsdes, designed to help with various tasks. In my case, it will hold a PCB and move it for easier soldering.

It is running on Raspberry Pi 5, is built almost entirely using 3D-printed parts, and uses 6 servomotors.
